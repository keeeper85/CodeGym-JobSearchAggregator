# CodeGym-JobSearchAggregator
Project at the end of level 38. In theory it's an aggregator for LinkedIn and Ineed job search results.  

However the task was based upon old version of these sites, before they required logging in. Thus the search engine is unavaiable now.
Still, it's a nice exercise for practising MVC and Strategy patterns tothether with JSoup html parsing.
